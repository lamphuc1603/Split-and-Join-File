Split and Join File Utility
Overview
This project provides a utility for splitting large files into smaller chunks and joining those chunks back into the original file. It can be useful for managing large files, transferring data in smaller parts, or processing files in chunks.

Features
File Splitting: Split a large file into multiple smaller files of specified size.
File Joining: Reconstruct the original file from the smaller chunks.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
Git (optional, for cloning the repository)
Installation
Clone the repository (if you haven't already):
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/split-join-file.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd split-join-file
Building the Project
Open the project in your preferred IDE or compile it manually using a terminal:
bash
Copy code
g++ -o split_join main.cpp JoinFile.cpp SplitFile.cpp
Replace g++ with your compiler if using something other than GCC.
Usage
Splitting a File
To split a file into smaller parts, run the program with the split command and specify the file and desired chunk size.

bash
Copy code
./split_join split <filename> <chunk_size>
<filename>: Path to the file you want to split.
<chunk_size>: Size of each chunk in bytes.
Example:

bash
Copy code
./split_join split largefile.txt 1024
Joining Files
To join the chunks back into the original file, run the program with the join command and specify the base name of the split files.

bash
Copy code
./split_join join <filename>
<filename>: Base name of the split files (e.g., largefile_part if files are named largefile_part1, largefile_part2, etc.)
Example:

bash
Copy code
./split_join join largefile
File Structure
main.cpp: The main entry point of the program.
JoinFile.cpp and JoinFile.h: Code for joining split files back into the original file.
SplitFile.cpp and SplitFile.h: Code for splitting a file into chunks.
